            </div>
            
            <div class="descriptions">
                <p class="des">The capacity to understand other people's mental states (e.g., desires, beliefs, intentions). It is an essential cognitive skill that allows individuals to understand and predict the behavior of others, empathize with their emotions, and engage in complex social interactions.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="details">
            <p class="details">To communicate and cooperate effectively, humans often need to consider the mental perspective of others and imagine how others represent things in the world. Theory of Mind is defined as the psychological reasoning about other people’s mental states including desires, beliefs, and sentiments. Over the past few decades, it has been receiving considerable attention and been explored in diverse aspects.</p>
            <p class="details">My research is addressing the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the scope and limitations of young children's Theory of Mind?</li>
                <li>What is the ontogenetic pathway of Theory of Mind development?</li>
                <li>How do young children rely on tracking others' experiences/encounters to reason about their beliefs and actions?</li>

                <p class="des">The ability to perceive or view a situation or an object from another person's perspective. Essentially, perspective taking allows individuals to put themselves in someone else's shoes and understand how they might perceive and experience a situation.</p>

            <p class="details">The capacity to take others' perspectives pervades human interaction and is key for healthy social development. Communication and cooperation are contexts in which having a sense of the other's perspective is especially important in order to coordinate one's activities with those of one's partner.</p>

            <div class="descriptions">
                <p class="des">Humans have a unique form of sociality that is not found in any other animal species. For example, humans engage in joint attention and share perspectives, ideas, and knowledge with one another. This unique way of engaging with others shapes humans’ cognition from the very beginning of their lives. The question we want to explore here is: How do children learn from/about other people and this social world?</p>

It includes the ways in which users process information, respond to virtual stimuli, and how their mental functions are influenced or altered by the virtual context. </p>
